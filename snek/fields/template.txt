- make sure the field size is accurate
- make sure the field is square shaped over all (will change later)
- '#' and 'O' count as obstacles, anything else will get overwritten by the snake and fruits
- game speed changes how fast the game gets drawn (ex. at 1000 it will update every 1000 ms)
- at faster game speeds, it may run slower than expected due to the CPU not being fast enough
- at larger fields, the screen may flicker a lot due to redrawing the whole field over and over
